as we can see the question mentions us to check the ```MOST SIGNIFICANCE BIT  ``` so we have the tools namely ```ZSTEG ABD JSTEG  ``` so the ZSTEG: is for images 
with the extension .png and .bmp 
but the JSTEG is for the .jpg
so as our image is png format so we need to move on with ZSTEG 
when we see the question they gave that the most significant bit will not be in left 
so using the ```zsteg --msb ``` we got to know that there is nothing useful so if ```zsteg --lsb ``` we can see the left most of the lsb contains flag which is in base-32
so by converting it to text we get the flag
