  We were given a png check so initally let's check using pngcheck and we find nothing suspicious. So as the question suggests we need more information of the original pic
  which wii be the metadata . so here we can use ```exiftool ``` or ```strings ``` to check and we will be getting a link and in that we have text in base-64 so if we convert to text we get the flag
