In this question we were given with a zip file so if we do ```unzip ``` we will be having one encrypted zip and a .jpg file so in the question as they mentioned the username is password 
and the username will be in metadata which can be extracted by using ```exiftool ``` so as the zip file is encrypted and the username can be extracted by checking the metadata of
the jpg and by that we can unzip that zip and get the flag
